# Java Cucumber API Test Automation Framework

A step-by-step API Test Automation Framework built using **Java**, **Cucumber (BDD)**, and **REST-assured**, designed with **IntelliJ IDEA**. This project covers fundamental to advanced topics in API testing, including automated validation of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), response codes, and working with nested JSON data.
